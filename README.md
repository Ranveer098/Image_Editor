## 1. Introduction
The **Advanced Image Editor Tool** is an interactive web-based application developed using **Streamlit** and **Python**.
It provides a suite of image processing functionalities, allowing users to edit and enhance images directly in their browsers.
This project demonstrates the application of digital image processing techniques in a user-friendly interface.

## 2. Objectives
- To design and implement an intuitive image editing tool using Python.
- To incorporate popular digital image processing techniques such as cropping, filtering, sharpening, edge detection, and contrast adjustments.
- To optimize computational efficiency and ensure high-quality image transformations.
- To provide real-time preview and download options for the edited images.

## 3. Methodology
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Identified key features to include, such as cropping, sharpening, filtering, and background removal.
2. **Algorithm Design**: Developed core image processing algorithms using **NumPy** for mathematical operations and **Pillow** for image manipulation.
3. **User Interface**: Created an interactive web interface using **Streamlit** to allow users to upload, edit, and download images.
4. **Testing**: Validated the accuracy and performance of each feature with various sample images.

## 4. Features Implemented
1. **Cropping**: Allows users to crop images dynamically using sliders for top, bottom, left, and right boundaries.
2. **Negative**: Converts the image to its negative by inverting the RGB values.
3. **Edge Detection**: Identifies edges using a Sobel filter for gradient-based detection.
4. **Remove Background**: Utilizes color clustering and masking to remove backgrounds effectively.
5. **Blur**: Applies Gaussian blur to soften images with adjustable blur radius.
6. **Sharpen**: Enhances image details using a convolution kernel while preserving color balance.
7. **Contrast Adjustment**: Modifies the contrast by scaling pixel values relative to their mean.
8. **Filters**:
   - **Sepia**: Applies a vintage tone by transforming RGB values.
   - **Vignette**: Adds a cinematic effect by darkening the edges.

## 5. Algorithms and Techniques
Detailed algorithms for cropping, negative conversion, edge detection, background removal, sharpening, and contrast adjustments are implemented using **NumPy** and basic image processing techniques.

## 6. Results and Analysis
- **Performance**: The application processes high-resolution images efficiently, with minimal computational overhead.
- **Accuracy**: Algorithms like sharpening and edge detection produce high-quality outputs without introducing color artifacts or distortions.
- **User Experience**: The interface is intuitive, and the real-time feedback enhances usability.

## 7. Conclusion
The **Advanced Image Editor Tool** successfully demonstrates the practical application of digital image processing techniques. It provides users with powerful tools to edit images directly in their browser, combining advanced algorithms with an intuitive interface.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- **AI-based Background Removal**: Replace color thresholding with deep learning-based segmentation for more robust background removal.
- **Custom Filters**: Add options for users to design and apply their custom filters.
- **Multiple Image Processing**: Enable batch processing for editing multiple images simultaneously.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improve the interface for use on mobile devices.
